When using it, all the hostages that may exist will always be spawned according to the configuration file with hostage spawns of the current map in game.

This is the only command that would make sense to disable because an innocent can't know if he's attacking an innocent or an imposter.<br><br><font color="lime"><b>BANNING FOR BEING AN IMPOSTOR AND HURTING IMPOSTORS</b></font>&nbsp;(sm_ttt_ban_impostor_hurt_impostor): It works the same as the previous one but for being an impostor and injuring or killing impostors.

For every time an innocent kills a hostage he will be taken as if he had injured 3 hostages. It isn't recommended to disable it because this would be most caused intentionally or by not knowing the rules.<br><br><font color="lime"><b>BAT TIME IN MINUTES</b></font>&nbsp;(sm_ttt_ban_time): The value of this command will determine the number of minutes that a player will be banned when committing any of the actions mentioned before.<br><br>To&nbsp;<u>DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC BAN SYSTEM</u>&nbsp;OF THE MOD, leave the following convars at 0:<br>sm_ttt_ban_innocent_hostage_hurt, sm_ttt_ban_impostor_hurt_impostor, sm_ttt_ban_innocent_hurt_innocent.<br>IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS THE SERVER ADMINS ARE ACTIVE, RELIABLE AND KNOW THE RULES, except for the sm_ttt_ban_innocent_hurt_innocent command that could be more logical than this at 0 due to the fact that innocents can't know if they are attacking an imposter or an innocent.<br><br><font color="darkorange"><font size="3"><b><u>CONFIGURATIONS PER NUMBER OF PLAYERS AND HOSTAGE SPAWNS:</u></b></font><br></font><br><br>To add or remove configurations per number of players (from 5 to 8 players there are 3 imposters for example, that type of configuration), you have to go to the following file: cstrike/addons/sourcemod/configs/ttt/ttt_configs_per_player_quantity.txt.<br><br>// FORMAT:<br><br>//| Number | Number |Number of hostages|Number of hostages| Hostage |<br>//| of | of | in the map at the | that must die | health |<br>//| players | impostors | beggining of the | for impostors | amount|<br>//| | | round | to win | |<br><br>//FROM 0 TO 4 PLAYERS THE FOLLOWING LINE WILL BE THE CONFIGS:<br>| 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 100 |<br>//FROM 5 TO 8 PLAYERS THE FOLLOWING LINE WILL BE THE CONFIGS:<br>| 8 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 200 |<br>//FROM 9 TO 11 PLAYERS THE FOLLOWING LINE WILL BE THE CONFIGS:<br>| 11 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 500 |<br>//THE SAME FOR ALL THE FOLLOWING LINES:<br>| 16 | 3 | 8 | 3 | 500 |<br>| 20 | 3 | 8 | 3 | 500 |<br>| 28 | 4 | 8 | 3 | 1000 |<br>| 36 | 4 | 8 | 3 | 500 |<br>| 42 | 5 | 8 | 3 | 500 |<br>// THE LAST LINE FROM 43 TO 65 PLAYERS (MAXIMUM OF CS:S).<br><br>// IS THE SAME IF YOU DO THE FOLLOWING:<br><br>4 1 2 2 100<br>8 1 4 2 200<br>11 2 6 2 500<br>16 3 8 3 500<br>20 3 8 3 500<br>28 4 8 3 1000<br>36 4 8 3 500<br>42 5 8 3 500<br><br>// ALWAYS THE VALUE OF Number Of Players HAS TO BE FROM LOWEST TO GREATEST ON // EACH LINE.<br><br>// IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE NUMBERS ARE SEPARATED BY '|' O ' ' (SPACES).

HOWEVER, TRY NOT TO WRITE TOO MANY CHARACTERS ON A SINGLE LINE.<br><br><font color="darkorange"><font size="3"><b><u>EDIT THE HOSTAGE SPAWNS CONFIGURATIONS:</u></b><br><br></font></font><br>Once we understand how the values will be written in the hostage spawns configuration file, we must know the following: If you want to make the configurations, you will have to do them for a specific map. To do this we will create a text file with the name of the map (for example, if you want to create a file with settings for de_dust2, the file must be called de_dust2.txt, and you will have to put it in the following address "cstrike/addons/sourcemod/configs/ttt/hostage_spawnpoints/<here goes="" the="" text="" file="" with="" map="" name="" class="SelectedElement"> ".<br><br>As the file is going to be empty we will have to look for the coordinates to add them to the file. To do that we will open the Counter-Strike: Source and once there we will create a game with the map for which we want to create the configurations. Once everything has loaded we will open the console in the game and type the following command there: cl_showpos 1 .<br><br>Once that is done, something like the following will appear on the screen in the upper right edge probably (if not elsewhere):<br><br>pos: 999.99 999.99 999.99<br>ang: 999.99 999.99 999.99<br>vel: 999.99<br><br>Once this appears, we must go to the position where we want the hostage to be spawn and for each spawn that we want to do, we must copy the pos and ang values in the position where the spawn will be and paste them into the text file that we created (all in the same line).<br>Let's imagine that what shows what came out after they typed the command cl_showpos 1 in the game console were variables, for example:<br><br>pos:&nbsp;<font color="Magenta">X1</font>&nbsp;<font color="Orange">Y1</font>&nbsp;<font color="Yellow">Z1</font><br>ang:&nbsp;<font color="Lime">X2</font>&nbsp;<font color="Cyan">Y2</font>&nbsp;<font color="DeepSkyBlue">Z2</font><br>vel: N<br><br>In the file that we created we should put:<br><br><font color="Magenta">X1</font>&nbsp;<font color="Orange">Y1</font>&nbsp;<font color="Yellow">Z1</font>&nbsp;<font color="Lime">X2</font>&nbsp;<font color="Cyan">Y2</font>&nbsp;<font color="DeepSkyBlue">Z2</font><br><br>In a different line for each new spawn.
